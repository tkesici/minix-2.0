  Module:       Interface to termcap database

(*
  Use this like the C-version. In this Modula-2 version, some of the buffers,
  that are explicit in the C-version, are hidden. These buffers are initialized
  by a call to Tgetent. The "ARRAY OF CHAR" parameters must be null-terminated.
  You can call them with a constant string argument, as these are always
  null-terminated in our Modula-2 implementation.
  Unlike the C version, this version takes care of UP, BC, PC, and ospeed
  automatically.
  If Tgetent is not called by the user, it is called by the module itself,
  using the TERM environment variable, or "dumb" if TERM does not exist.
